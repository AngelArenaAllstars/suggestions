I think that Diablo and Dota have some similarities in the control of the heroes (more than Dark Souls), so I think that it would
be a good idea to take some of their bosses, from Diablo II and III and from Titan Quest (similar), as models for the design of
the heroes in AngelArenaAllstars (or AngelArena 2), I'm sure there are mechanics you can use:
