How to submit an idea:
----------------------

Just open a new Issue. It is the 2nd tab, right next to code;
Don't try to create pull requests; that is not their purpose.

Make sure to prepend the title with the type/category in brackets:
- [Item] title
- [Boss] title
- [Mechanics] title
- [Spell] title
- [Boss mechanics] title
- [Lore] title
etc

What to include in an idea:
---------------------------

The general premise of your idea. Try to use the technical terms of Dota, and as little flavour as possible.

A good example would be for an item:
> Area targeted spell, creates a damaging ring, that also reduces armor over time.

You don't even have to include numbers, components or costs; they will be changed a 100 times anyway.

A bad example would be where you write 3 paragraphs about the origin of the item and list a bunch of stats.
