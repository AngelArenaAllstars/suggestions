New heroes:
-----------

> Don't. 

New heroes are not a priority. There won't be any new heroes added to the mod, until the core mechanics and major bugs are fixed. Don't expect it very soon.

Hero reworks:
-------------

If you have Ideas about existing heroes, for example if you think a specific heroes specific ability won't do much in this mode, or won't useful enough then go ahead.
Just make sure to include a detailed reasoning of your issues, and suggestions to improve them. Just bear in mind, that it is probably too soon for this too.
