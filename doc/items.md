# Items

[Home](../README.md) > [Guidelines for contributing](guidelines.md) > Items

### General concepts
- Try to focus on sidegrades and alternatives, and not the most OP badass item
- Provide reasoning for the items use, and your motivation to create it
- Focus on utility and not on stats, it is more important what the item is good for than how much damage it gives
- Avoid items that just give "extra inventory space", like combining Tranquil Boots with Blink dagger
- Try to come up items with interesting abilities, not just x% chance to deal more damage
- The item doesn't have to be useful throughout the whole game

### Stats
All stats on items makes support classes fall behind in the mid-, lategame.

Try to avoid `+ x to all stats`, instead if your Item would give +10 to all stats, 
then split it up like so depending on which class of heroes are you targeting:

#### Supports
- +200 Hp
- +10 int

#### Carries
- +200 Hp
- +10 Agi

#### Tanks/Initiator
- +10 Str
- +10 Int
- +1-2 Armor
