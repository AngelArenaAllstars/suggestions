# Items

[Back](../README.md)

### General concepts
- Try to focus on sidegrades and alternatives, and not the most OP badass item
- Provide reasoning for the items use, and your motivation to create it
- Focus on utility and not on stats, it is more important what the item is good for than how much damage it gives
- Avoid items that just give "extra inventory space", like combining Tranquil Boots with Blink dagger
- Try to come up items with interesting abilities, not just x% chance to deal more damage
- The item doesn't have to be useful throughout the whole game

### Stats
All stats on items makes support classes fall behind in the mid-, lategame.

Try to avoid `+ x to all stats`, instead if your Item would give +10 to all stats, 
then split it up like so depending on which class of heroes are you targeting:

#### Supports
- +200 Hp
- +120 Mana
- +10 Damage maybe 
- you may ignore the the +0.4 Mana regeneration and the +0.3 Hp regeneration

#### Carries
- +200 Hp
- +10 Attack Speed
- +10 damage
- you may ignore the the +0.4 Mana regeneration and the +0.3 Hp regeneration and the +120 Mana

#### Tanks/Initiators
- +200 Hp
- +120 Mana
- +1-2 Armor
- +1 Hp regeneration
